## When analyzing COVID-19 data for Calfironia and New York, our goal was to find answers to the following questions: 
1. Which state followed the stay-at-home order more effectively? 
2. What if CA and NY does not adhere to the stay-at-home order? 
3. Does the stay-at-home order affect air pollution in our two states? If so, is it a positive or negative implact? 

Check out our PowerPoint to review our findings.
